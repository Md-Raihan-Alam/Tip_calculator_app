## My process

### Built with

--HTML5
--SASS
--JS

-Well I did not expect that css will be around 500 lines after I type all code using sass framework Sass is awesome 

## What I have learned

--As this is my first project using sass instead of css it took some of my time, but now I think I am gonnal type all stylesheet using sass only
--I have good amount of practice with JS part.
--There were some problem that I face , like all buttons gets color and background-color instead of one or when I click one, then warning text was
  not appearing when needed, Well I had to solved this problem using booleans, speacifically speaking the problem was happening because of bool code misplaced, So I had to refactor some code
